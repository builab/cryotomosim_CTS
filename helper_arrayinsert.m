function [output, overlap] = helper_arrayinsert(dest,source,coord,method)
%inserts source into dest array at [coords] by the algorithm of "method".
%method can be sum(default),min,max,mean (self explanatory) replace, overlaptest, or nonoverlap
%replace replaces all values in the target region of dest
%overlaptest outputs overlap=1 if the sum would cause an overlap of objects, output is unmodified dest
%nonoverlap works as overlaptest, but if overlap!=1 also adds source to dest as output

%logical indexing is sometimes faster, but due to generating log/linear indexes is always slower

%is a loop faster by avoiding temporary array nonsense?
%avoid indexing on the right side somehow?
